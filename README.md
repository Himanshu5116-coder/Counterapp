Component Overview
The main logic is contained within the App component in CounterApp.jsx.

The useState hook initializes and manages the count state.

increment() and decrement() functions modify the state.

The component renders the current count and two buttons to trigger the state changes.

Conditional rendering is used to display a warning paragraph only when the count is less than 0.
